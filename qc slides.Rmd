# Unexplored microfoundations

> Do voters' judgments sensibly differentiate competent from incompetent incumbents?  

&nbsp;

### Central task of retrospective voting requires
- **Integration** over stream of performance info
- **Appraisal** of impression
  
### I/A largely unseen
- Observational limitations
- Experimental short-circuit

# Short-circuiting I/A in experiments

- Vignette provides 
  - pre\-integrated summary ("deteriorated a lot")
  - appraisal cue ("considerably worse")
- Have yet to study I/A in controlled setting

### Game Flow

2. Monitor factory output, $F_{pre}$
3. Incumbent arrives in week 8

5. Vote on reappointment

### Unmasking Design: Extract competece?
- $F_{pre} = C_{pre}$
- Incumbent works alongside Comparator
- $F_{post} = C_{post} + I_{post}$

### Estimating response, multiworker games

Model reappointment as function of output in each stage

$$Reappoint_i = \alpha F_{pre,i} + \beta F_{post,i} + \theta + u_i$$

### Predictions from conventional theories

| Strategy       | Pre-Inc, $F_{pre}$  | Inc tenure, $F_{post}$   |
|:---------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Blind retrospection  | $\alpha > 0$ | $\beta>0$      |
| Rational discounting | $\alpha = 0$ | $\beta>0$, $\beta=f(\kappa)$  |
| Benchmark comparison | $\alpha < 0$ | $\beta>0$ |


---
# Consistent benchmark response

&nbsp;

$$Reappoint_i = \alpha F_{pre,i} + \beta F_{post,i} + \theta + u_i$$

# Overview of experimental results

- I/A over variable streams
  - Capable judges of competence
  - Clear strategy to confront spillover

- Clear limitations
  - Sub-optimal decisions
  - Recency bias; maybe some negativity bias

- So much benchmarking
  - Quick to I/A by comparison
  - Evidence of benchmark-seeking
  - Benchmarking as baseline strategy

- The target of generalization is abstract
- Design should follow epistemic aim

realism, some—but not all!—laboratory and survey experiments do not and thus provide a poor basis for external validity inferences

# Specific criteria for abstract designs

&nbsp;

Evaluating 'synthetic' designs for testing theory
- Identify theory testing as central goal
- Ground efforts at generalization in theory
- Specify models or a priori propositions under study  

&nbsp;

- Env captures only essential essence of the models
- Creates space for target behaviors to emerge
- Balances experimental realism with integrity of abstract env

# *Quality Control* and next steps

- Voters and the integration-appraisal task
  - Not so sophisticated. Not kicking dogs.
  - Reasonably effective, strategic 

- Of theories and voters

- Next steps  
  - Appraise first, integrate late?
  - Role of appraisal cues in I/A
