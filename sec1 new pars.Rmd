## What's at stake?

We outline a framework for studying retrospective voting and present eleven experimental tests of its micro foundations. What do we expect to achieve? Testing and advancing theories of retrospective voting sheds light on the normative significance of one of the most widely-observed patterns of voting behavior. What do we learn about the possibility of retrospective accountability when we observe, for example, voters sanctioning an incumbent in the midst of a recession? Similarly, what does it tell us about individual interest in or capacity for integration and appraisal where we see electorates failing to sanction or reward their government? These questions are fundamental to the literature on performance voting, and their answers depend squarely on the causal mechanisms at work.

We also hope that the I/A framework and experimental design that we outline in this Element will motivate new programs of research in retrospective voting. Our experiments are among the first to consider integration and appraisal in tandem, and hope that this will serve as a promising avenue for revitalizing theoretical debates in the field and for reconciling some of the carefully-estimated but often conflicting findings in observational research.

## Why experiment?

Nearly all prior studies of retrospective voting rely on observational designs. This work identifies a clear and widespread reaction among voters to indicators of performance. Yet fundamental questions remain about the micro foundations of this retrospective response. Unpacking the integration-appraisal process requires the researcher to identify the specific streams of performance information that voters encounter and then observe their response to each. Neither is typically feasible with observational data.

An experimental approach offers a way forward. We manipulate the parameters of government performance *and* spillover and then control individual exposure to these streams. Because we do this in a simplified environment that allows the integration and appraisal process to unfold with minimal intervention, we can design direct tests of competing mechanisms of retrospective voting.

The dearth of experimental tests of retrospective voting is curious given the expansiveness of the literature and widespread adoption of experimental methods in voting behavior research. We suspect that this reflects the difficulty of credibly manipulating streams of performance in an experimental setting. This is especially true if the researcher attempts to simulate an explicitly political competition among parties or candidates. This may be why most prior experiments in retrospective voting offer an explicit integration and/or appraisal and then measure the reaction. Unfortunately, as with careful observational studies, this work may be able to demonstrate *that* voters respond to performance but not how or why. As we develop further in Sections 2 and 3, our factory worker analogy overcomes these hurdles.

## Wither social identity?

Existing theories of retrospective voting say very little about how social identities may interact with the integration-appraisal process. They do, however, suggest that identities, especially partisan identity, may suppress the magnitude of the retrospective vote. That may be true.
